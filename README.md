# Getting started

The magiclinksdev project is an authentication service that uses magic links to authenticate users. A typical use case
would involve sending a magic link to a user via email. After the user clicks the link, a new authenticated session is
created for that user. Sometimes "magiclinksdev" is abbreviated as "mld".

You can find the documentation for this project on the [docs site](https://docs.magiclinks.dev). This site contains
resources for implementing a client and self-hosting the project.

## Implementing a client application

Client applications are programs that use the magiclinksdev project to authenticate their users. Check out the
[**SDKs**](https://docs.magiclinks.dev/sdks) page to get started with an existing SDK. If you can't find an SDK for your
language, you can use the [**Specification**](https://docs.magiclinks.dev/specification) to implement your own client by
hand or code generation. To learn more about the client workflow, check out the
[**Workflow**](https://docs.magiclinks.dev/workflow) page.

## Self-hosting the service

The magiclinksdev project can be self-hosted. Check out the [**Quickstart**](https://docs.magiclinks.dev/quickstart)
page to get started in minutes. For reference on configuring your self-hosted instance, check out the
[**Configuration**](https://docs.magiclinks.dev/configuration).
